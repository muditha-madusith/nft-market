# Next.js Marketplace Project

This repository contains the code for my Next.js Marketplace project. The purpose of this project is to practice and enhance my technical skills by building a marketplace application using Next.js.




### Project Overview

1. User authentication: Users will be able to create accounts, log in, and log out. Only authenticated users will be able to list products for sale or make purchases.
2. Product listing: Authenticated users will have the ability to list products they want to sell. They will provide product details such as title, description, price, and images.
3. User Profiles: Users can see what are they buying and created items for selling.
### Technologies Used

The Next.js Marketplace project will be built using the following technologies:

1. Next.js: A React framework for building server-side rendered and static web applications.
2. React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
3. Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment for executing server-side code.
4. Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js that will handle server-side logic and API endpoints.
5. MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing user accounts, products, and other relevant data.
6. Github-Desktop: A version control system for managing and tracking changes to the codebase.
7. Stripe: A secure payment processing platform that will be integrated for handling transactions. I hope using this for my payment processing but currently not add this.
### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: git clone [repository-url]
